Here's my annually Project.2022 is really a significant year,I will update almost I get progress in something.

1.Of cource is CoCloud
CoCloud is my first project.Aiming to reduce people's waiting time for downloading things in the internet and give users a large space to save their files through almost all devices(Contribute By Powerful WebDav).We has opened last year and now it's working perfectly.
In China mainland,many company provides their (rubbish)cloud storange,BUT WITH LIMIT SPEED.  That's why CoCloud born today.

2.Toolbox
We always need to search many website when we need to deal something online.Our Toolbox give you a One-Site-To-All experience.
But now it is in developing,we need time to add some new features in that.

3.CoCVision
That's the Best Project I have ever made.When CoCloud open to public,many people ask me to make a Video Website so that they can watch their movie(or Anime)Wherever they are.
Now with KYCC(a good 'Airport')'s support.We opened Our Video Project------CoCVision.
We are now put CoCVison in to our master Project.I think We will have more and more movies(animes)uploaded to our website.

And So on

We have many small projects,we will pack them and upload to there.(Also as a backup)

At last I want to say CoC begin with Netdisk,it's says we are not Aiming to Earn you money.As you see Beacause I am a Junior Student,I don't have much time to do my projects,All you money has been used to Improve our server.

OK,Have a Nice Day.
